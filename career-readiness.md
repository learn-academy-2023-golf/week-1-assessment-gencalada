# ASSESSMENT 1: Career Readiness

The LEARN program focuses on readying our students for a career in technology. The job hunt is a daunting process that requires a lot of preparedness. Complete the following tasks to ensure progress in your professional development.

LinkedIn is the world's largest online professional networking community. An active presence on LinkedIn allows you to make professional connections, look for employment opportunities, connect with others who share your interests, and learn more about the tech industry.

- Submit your "about me" statement:
console.log("Hello Everybody!") 
My name is Gregory Encalada. You may not know just by looking at me but I have a shrine in my living room dedicated to Star Wars and Harry Potter. One thing I have learned in my 26 geeky years of life is that I have a passion for helping others. Whether that would be by bringing a smile to peoples faces, mentoring and inspiring others, or even just being there for someone during their more vulnerable times. I am currently a student at LEARN academy where I am aspiring and on my way to becoming a full stack developer. With the newfound skills I am learning I have a few career routes I have been looking into. One specifically that I have entertained is hopefully joining Disney's team of developers and helping the company continue to bring smiles to people around the world.
