# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: a conditional statement is a set of code which can be influenced by whether or not certain values are true.

Researched answer: a conditional statement is a set of code that contains an evaluation or even a set of evaluations within it. Depending on what evaluations are true will determine what will be executed thus influencing the output. They always start with with the word if. They are also known as if/else statements. If the evaluation of a coonditional statement returns as false, then nothing will be executed and no output will be given.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: So git is the technology on out local device that allows us to work on code. GitHub on the other hand is an environment that allows to the storage of what we work on using git. This environment allows us to collaberate with others on a grander scale.

Researched answer: So git is what we install on your local device that allows us to manage our source code history. Thats just a fancy way of saying it allows us to be able to keep track of our progress in our code as we add onto it. GitHub, on the other hand, is not local. infact, utilizing multiple internet and cloud based  servers arund the world, it is a cloud based environment that allows us to store our code or...git version control projects...and makes it more efficient to collaborate with others.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: In an array, as opposed to a string, each index value is given to not the first character in that array but a set of characters that make up that first set of data.

Researched answer:So, as opposed to strings, where each index value is asigned to a character. In an array, each index value is asigned to an element. An example of this is when dealing with strings, lets say we have const = "hello". an index value of zero is assigned to the letter h, 1 to the letter e, and so on. In an array, lets say we have const= [hello world]. The index value of 0 is given to the word hello, and one assigned to world.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Strings and arrays both have the ability to store information. However, one key difference is what each is more efficient at storing. Arrays are generally used for storing large ammounts of data and even different datatypes, meanwhile, strings are more character based or text valued. Data within an array are called elements, while, they are called characters in a string. the difference can be seen when calling the value of an index in a string and an array. Another key difference is strings is once assigned data, its content cannot be changed. In an array, multiple tools can be used to modify the data in an array. Some tools will alter the main array, whule other tools, may create a new one.

Researched answer:

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: the four pillars of object oriented programming are data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. All four allow the code we are working with to be easily understood, reduce the chance of misused data, and versatile to other developers.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions are able to use regular functions as an argument and can return a funtion.

2. Jest: Jest is a framework that creates and environment for testing.

3. Objects: Objects are a data type that can contain static information and actions.
